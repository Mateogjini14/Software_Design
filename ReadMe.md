# Project Software Design 2023

Website Idea: Skillshare360


 Skillshare360 is an online learning platform that offers courses on various skills and subjects. The website will have three levels of users - Learner, Premium, and Instructor.

Learners can create a profile, browse and enroll in courses, and track their progress. They can also join study groups and participate in discussions with other learners.

Premium users will have access to additional features such as personalized course recommendations, early access to new courses, and exclusive content from renowned instructors. They can also create their own study groups and invite other learners to join.

Instructors will have all the features of Learner and Premium users, as well as additional benefits such as the ability to create and sell their own courses, connect with potential clients, and participate in virtual events and workshops. They can also use the platform to showcase their expertise and promote their services.


Extra Information:
Skillshare360 will generate revenue through a commission-based model, where instructors earn a percentage of the revenue from the courses they sell. Additionally, the website can partner with companies and organizations to provide sponsored courses and offer exclusive discounts and offers to its users.
